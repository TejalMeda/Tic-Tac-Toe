# TicTacToe
This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe developed in Python. It allows two players to play with one another on different command lines through networking. 
The server starts the game by first running server.py, waiting for the client to connect by then running client.py. Once their connected, the game itself starts.
The server starts as "X" and goes first, and the client is "O." 
The players choose the square they would like to use with coordinates; both "A1" and "1A" would be accepted, for example. 
The game proceeds, with the players taking turns, until one wins or the game is a draw. 
The host, then the client, is asked whether they'd like a rematch. If both agree, the game starts anew.
